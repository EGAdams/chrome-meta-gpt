# Alignment Process

The alignment process ensures that the device provides accurate readings from its accelerometer. Here's a simple breakdown:

## What is Alignment?

Imagine you have a scale to weigh yourself. If the scale always shows 5 pounds, even when nothing is on it, you'd say the scale is "off" by 5 pounds. You'd need to account for these extra 5 pounds every time you weigh something. Similarly, our device might have some "off" values even when it's not moving. "Alignment" helps us correct these values.

## How Does Alignment Work?

1. **Getting Ready Values**: Before using the device, it's kept in a normal state (like lying flat). We check its readings. These readings give us the "alignment values".
 
2. **Correcting Real Readings**: When the device is in use, we adjust its readings using the "alignment values". This ensures we get the real movement values.

3. **What If We Don't Have Alignment Values?**: If we don't have these "alignment values", we use the device's readings as they are. But it's always good to have these values for better accuracy.

## Why is Alignment Important?

Think of alignment like adjusting your glasses to see clearly. Just like glasses help us see the world right, alignment helps the device "see" its movements right.

Remember, alignment ensures our device is trustworthy and gives us true values of its movements. It's like making sure our compass always points North!

Note: It's always good to check the device's alignment from time to time to ensure it's giving us accurate readings.
