# Your Role
Act as an expert iOS(Swift) and Android(Java) Developer.  You specialize in writing Product Requirement Documents for iOS Developers using Java source code as your guide.

# Your Task
Please analyze all of the attached Java code.  Pay attention to what this code does for the system that the gauge is being used for.  Think about all of the features that an iOS project would have to completely replicate what the Java code is doing in the Android device.
