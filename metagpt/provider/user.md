## UI Design draft:
The app will have a clean and modern design. The main screen will display the speedometer gauge with customizable visual elements such as the rim, face, and tick marks. The gauge will show the real-time speed and yaw of the aircraft. The user will be able to adjust the gauge metrics and save them for future use. The app will also integrate other aviation metrics such as altitude, rate of ascent/descent, direction, orientation, remaining distance to the destination, and barometric pressure readings. The user interface will be intuitive and easy to understand, with clear labels and visual indicators for each metric. The app will provide smooth visual transitions using Core Animation for a fluid and responsive user experience.

## Anything Unclear:
There are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach
To design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the airplane speedometer gauge app, I will follow the following approach:

1. **Development Environment**: I will use Swift as the primary programming language and utilize UIKit for the main development components. This will ensure compatibility and familiarity with iOS development standards.

2. **Core Features**: To ensure real-time representation of aviation metrics such as speed and yaw, I will use the Core Motion framework provided by Apple. This framework provides access to the device's accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, allowing us to measure and display the required metrics accurately.

   For customizable visual elements of the speedometer gauge, I will leverage the power of Core Graphics. This framework provides the necessary tools to create custom graphics and animations for the gauge's rim, face, and tick marks.

   To implement smooth visual transitions using Core Animation, I will utilize the Core Animation framework. This framework provides high-performance animation capabilities, allowing for fluid transitions between different speedometer gauge visuals.

3. **Data Management**: For adjusting, saving, and retrieving gauge metrics, I will use Core Data, Apple's recommended framework for data persistence in iOS applications. Core Data provides an object-oriented approach to data management and integrates seamlessly with UIKit.

   To leverage MySQL for persistent storage of gauge metrics, I will use an open-source Swift library called MySQLConnector. This library provides a Swift interface to interact with MySQL databases, allowing us to store and retrieve gauge metrics securely.

4. **Compatibility & User Experience**: To ensure a seamless experience across various iOS devices, I will follow Apple's guidelines for adaptive user interfaces. This will involve using Auto Layout and Size Classes to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

   For an intuitive user interface design, I will utilize the power of UIKit's built-in controls and components. This will include using labels, sliders, and buttons to display and interact with gauge metrics. I will also focus on clear labeling and visual indicators to enhance the user's understanding of speed measurements.

5. **Integration**: To measure and display G-forces experienced by the aircraft using the device's accelerometer, I will utilize the Core Motion framework. This framework provides access to raw accelerometer data, allowing us to calculate and display G-forces accurately.

   To measure the current altitude of the aircraft using the device's GPS and barometer, I will utilize the Core Location framework. This framework provides access to the device's GPS and barometer data, allowing us to calculate and display altitude accurately.

   To display the rate at which the aircraft is ascending or descending using the device's barometer, I will again utilize the Core Location framework. This framework provides access to barometric pressure data, allowing us to calculate and display the rate of ascent or descent accurately.

   To show the current direction or bearing of the aircraft using the device's magnetometer and GPS, I will utilize the Core Location framework. This framework provides access to magnetometer and GPS data, allowing us to calculate and display the direction accurately.

   To show the aircraft's orientation in terms of yaw, pitch, and roll angles using the device's gyroscope, I will utilize the Core Motion framework. This framework provides access to raw gyroscope data, allowing us to calculate and display the orientation accurately.

   To calculate and display the remaining distance to the set destination or waypoint using the device's GPS, I will again utilize the Core Location framework. This framework provides access to GPS data, allowing us to calculate and display the remaining distance accurately.

   To offer real-time barometric pressure readings using the device's barometer, I will utilize the Core Location framework. This framework provides access to barometric pressure data, allowing us to display real-time readings accurately.

   To detect and warn pilots about potential turbulent areas using the device's accelerometer, I will utilize the Core Motion framework. This framework provides access to raw accelerometer data, allowing us to detect sudden changes in acceleration and warn pilots accordingly.
