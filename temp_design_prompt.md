[Product Manager: ## Original Requirements:

[BOSS: Develop an iOS application for iPad and iPhone that functions as an airplane speedometer gauge. Use Swift and UIKit for the main development. Ensure real-time representation of speed, yaw, and other metrics. Incorporate customizable visual elements (rim, face, ticks) and leverage Core Animation for smooth visual transitions. Implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL. Prioritize compatibility across iOS devices and ensure an intuitive user experience. Provide synchronization capabilities with other aviation-related iOS applications.]

## Product Goals:
```python
[
    "Create a high-performance iOS application for iPad and iPhone",
    "Provide real-time representation of speed, yaw, and other metrics",
    "Offer customizable visual elements and smooth visual transitions"
]
```

## User Stories:
```python
[
    "As a pilot, I want to have a reliable speedometer gauge on my iPad or iPhone, so I can monitor my aircraft's speed during flights.",
    "As an aviation enthusiast, I want to customize the visual elements of the speedometer gauge, so I can personalize it to my liking.",
    "As a user, I want the speedometer gauge to provide real-time updates, so I can have accurate and up-to-date information.",
    "As a pilot, I want to be able to save and retrieve gauge metrics, so I can analyze my flight data later.",
    "As a user, I want the speedometer gauge to be compatible with different iOS devices, so I can use it on my preferred device."
]
```

## Competitive Analysis:
```python
[
    "Speedometer Pro: A popular speedometer app with customizable visual elements and real-time updates.",
    "Aviation Speed Gauge: An aviation-specific speedometer app with synchronization capabilities.",
    "Flight Speedometer: A speedometer app designed for pilots with a user-friendly interface.",
    "Speedometer Deluxe: A feature-rich speedometer app with smooth visual transitions.",
    "AeroSpeed: An aviation speedometer app with compatibility across iOS devices.",
    "Speedometer Master: A speedometer app with advanced metrics and data analysis features.",

## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be a high-performance iOS application that functions as an airplane speedometer gauge. It should provide real-time representation of speed, yaw, and other metrics. The application should incorporate customizable visual elements (rim, face, ticks) and leverage Core Animation for smooth visual transitions. It should also implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL. The application should prioritize compatibility across iOS devices and ensure an intuitive user experience. Additionally, it should provide synchronization capabilities with other aviation-related iOS applications.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("Implement real-time representation of yaw and other metrics", "P0"),
    ("Add customizable visual elements (rim, face, ticks)", "P1"),
    ("Integrate Core Animation for smooth visual transitions", "P1"),
    ("Implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL", "P0"),
    ("Ensure compatibility across iOS devices", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft:
The speedometer gauge will have a circular design with a customizable rim, face, and ticks. It will display the current speed, yaw, and other metrics in real-time. The gauge will have smooth visual transitions, thanks to Core Animation. Users will be able to adjust the gauge metrics and save them for later retrieval. The application will have an intuitive user interface, compatible with different iOS devices.
