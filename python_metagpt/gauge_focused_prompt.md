# iOS Gauge Widget Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Context
The primary goal is to develop a gauge widget for iOS applications, specifically tailored for aviation metrics. This widget should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and be designed to fit within a larger application.

## Instructions:

### Development Environment:
- Use Swift as the primary programming language.
- Utilize UIKit for the main development components.

### Core Features:
- Ensure real-time representation of aviation metrics such as speed.
- Implement smooth visual transitions, possibly using Core Animation for smoother hand movement.
- Allow customizable visual elements for the gauge, including:
  - Rim appearance (`rimPaint`)
  - Face of the speedometer (`faceRect`)
  - Scale marks (`scaleTickPaint`, `scaleTextPaint`)
  - Different scales' color representation (`yellowScalePaint`, `greenScalePaint`, `redScalePaint`)
  - Hand of the speedometer (`handPaint`)
  - Hand of the Yaw gauge in the inner circle of the gauge (`handPaint`)

### Data Management:
- Implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics.
- Use MySQL for persistent storage of these metrics, recording the widget's values as needed.

### Compatibility & User Experience:
- Ensure compatibility across various iOS devices.
- Design an intuitive user interface, with clear visuals making it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance.
- Allow customization of the gauge's appearance based on user preferences or application themes.

### Integration:
- The widget should be designed modularly, allowing easy integration into larger applications and accommodating additional metrics, as seen in the initial PRD.
