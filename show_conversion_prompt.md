Very good, thank you.

# More Tasks for You
- Focus on the part of the system that converts raw values based on configuration.
- We are only using one configuration, so let's just focus on converting the raw values with this configuration only:

```java
speedometerScales = {5, 10, 20, 40, 100};
```

- Using this configuration, please explain in verbose detail how the system converts raw values into something that we can use.  Use the mermaid sequence diagram as you have done before to make things more clear.
